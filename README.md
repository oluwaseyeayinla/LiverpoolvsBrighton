# LiverpoolvsBrighton
**LiverpoolvsBrighton** is a small football simulation about the 2018 premier league season match between Liverpool (Home Team) 
and Brighton (Away Team) on Saturday the 25th August. The project is based on Udacity's score keeper app. You can either score
a goal or send off a player from either team. Liverpool eventually won the match by a lone goal from **Mo Salah 23'**
